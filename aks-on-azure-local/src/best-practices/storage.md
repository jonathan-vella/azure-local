# Storage Configuration Best Practices for Azure Local Kubernetes

## Storage Types
- **Premium SSD or NVMe**: Recommended for production environments, especially for workloads requiring high IOPS and low latency.
- **Standard SSD**: Suitable for general-purpose workloads with moderate performance requirements.
- **Standard HDD**: Can be used for less critical workloads where performance is not a primary concern.

## Mirroring Strategies
- **3-Way Mirroring**: Essential for critical data to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. This configuration provides redundancy and protects against data loss.
- **2-Way Mirroring**: Can be used for less critical data where some level of redundancy is acceptable, but it does not provide the same level of fault tolerance as 3-way mirroring.

## Storage Pool Sizing
- Always size storage pools with at least **30% additional capacity** to accommodate snapshots, growth, and unexpected increases in demand.
- Regularly monitor storage utilization to ensure that capacity planning aligns with actual usage patterns.

## Performance Testing
- Conduct performance testing using tools like **FIO** or **DiskSpd** to validate storage performance before deploying workloads to production.
- Test different configurations to determine the optimal setup for your specific workload requirements.

## Backup and Recovery
- Implement a robust backup strategy that includes regular snapshots and offsite backups to protect against data loss.
- Ensure that recovery procedures are tested and documented to minimize downtime in case of failures.

By following these best practices, you can optimize storage configurations for your Azure Local Kubernetes environment, ensuring high performance, availability, and reliability for your applications.
