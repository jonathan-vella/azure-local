# Node Placement Strategies for Kubernetes

## Node Placement Best Practices

- **Distribute Control Plane Nodes**: Ensure that Kubernetes control plane nodes are distributed across multiple physical hosts to enhance fault tolerance and availability. This minimizes the risk of a single point of failure affecting the entire control plane.

- **Use Anti-Affinity Rules**: Implement anti-affinity rules for critical stateful workloads to prevent them from being scheduled on the same node. This ensures that if one node fails, the workloads remain operational on other nodes.

- **Specialized Workload Taints and Tolerations**: Configure taints and tolerations for specialized workloads, such as those requiring GPU or high memory. This allows you to control which nodes can run specific workloads, optimizing resource utilization.

- **Node Pools for Workload Types**: Consider creating dedicated node pools for different types of workloads (e.g., stateless vs. stateful). This allows for tailored resource allocation and management strategies based on the specific needs of each workload type.

- **Resource Requests and Limits**: Set appropriate resource requests and limits for pods to ensure that the Kubernetes scheduler can make informed decisions about pod placement. This helps in achieving balanced resource utilization across nodes.

- **Monitoring and Adjustments**: Continuously monitor node performance and workload distribution. Be prepared to adjust node placements and configurations based on observed performance metrics and changing workload demands.

- **Consider Network Topology**: Take into account the network topology when placing nodes. Ensure that nodes that communicate frequently are placed in close proximity to reduce latency and improve performance.

By following these node placement strategies, you can enhance the reliability, performance, and efficiency of your Kubernetes cluster on Azure Local.
