# Azure Local Kubernetes Network Best Practices

## Network Configuration

- **Networking Speeds**: Use at least 10 Gbps networking for production environments to ensure optimal performance and low latency.
  
- **Network Segmentation**: Implement separate networks for management, VM traffic, and storage to enhance security and performance.

- **IP Address Space Reservations**:
  - Reserve sufficient IP address space for pod and service networks to avoid conflicts and ensure scalability.
  - Default pod CIDR: `10.244.0.0/16`
  - Default service CIDR: `10.96.0.0/16`

## Additional Recommendations

- **Load Balancing**: Utilize Azure Load Balancer or other load balancing solutions to distribute traffic evenly across pods and services.

- **Network Policies**: Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to control traffic flow between pods, enhancing security and compliance.

- **Monitoring Network Performance**: Regularly monitor network performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimize configurations.

By following these best practices, you can ensure a robust and efficient network configuration for your Azure Local Kubernetes environment.
