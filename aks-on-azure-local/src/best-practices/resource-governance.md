# Resource Governance Best Practices

## Resource Quotas
- Implement resource quotas at the namespace level to limit the amount of resources (CPU and memory) that can be consumed by the pods in a namespace. This helps prevent a single application from monopolizing cluster resources.

## Pod Disruption Budgets
- Use pod disruption budgets (PDBs) to specify the minimum number of pods that must be available during voluntary disruptions (e.g., node maintenance). This ensures that critical services remain available even during maintenance activities.

## Quality of Service (QoS) Classes
- Implement quality of service (QoS) classes for workload prioritization. Kubernetes provides three QoS classes:
  - **Guaranteed**: For pods that have both requests and limits set, and they are equal. These pods are given the highest priority.
  - **Burstable**: For pods that have requests and limits set, but they are not equal. These pods can use more resources when available but are limited when resources are scarce.
  - **BestEffort**: For pods that do not have any requests or limits set. These pods are given the lowest priority and can be evicted when resources are needed by higher-priority pods.

## Resource Requests and Limits
- Always define resource requests and limits for your containers. Requests ensure that the scheduler places the pod on a node with sufficient resources, while limits prevent a pod from consuming excessive resources that could affect other workloads.

## Monitoring and Alerts
- Continuously monitor resource usage and set up alerts for resource constraints. This helps in identifying potential issues before they impact application performance.

## Regular Reviews
- Conduct regular reviews of resource allocations and usage patterns to adjust quotas, limits, and budgets as necessary. This ensures that the resource governance policies remain effective and aligned with the evolving needs of the applications.
