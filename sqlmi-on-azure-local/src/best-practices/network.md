# Network Configuration Best Practices for Azure Arc SQL MI

This document outlines the best practices for configuring networking for Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance deployments in Azure Local environments.

## Network Architecture

A well-designed network architecture is crucial for the performance, security, and reliability of SQL Managed Instance deployments on Azure Local.

### Network Topology Recommendations

1. **Segmentation**:
   - Separate the Kubernetes cluster network from other infrastructure
   - Use network security groups or firewall rules to control traffic
   - Implement a dedicated subnet for database traffic

2. **Bandwidth Requirements**:
   - Internal network: 10 Gbps minimum recommended
   - External client connectivity: Based on workload requirements
   - Consider redundant network paths for high availability

3. **Latency Considerations**:
   - Keep network latency between nodes below 1ms for optimal performance
   - Minimize network hops between SQL MI and client applications
   - Use ExpressRoute or VPN for Azure connectivity with low latency

## Network Security Best Practices

1. **Secure Access**:
   - Implement network policies to control pod-to-pod communication
   - Use TLS encryption for all SQL connections
   - Apply principle of least privilege for network access

2. **Endpoint Security**:
   - Configure SQL MI endpoints with proper authentication
   - Use Azure Active Directory authentication when possible
   - Restrict access to management endpoints

3. **Traffic Protection**:
   - Encrypt all data in transit
   - Use network security groups to filter traffic
   - Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems

## SQL MI Connectivity

### Connection Methods

1. **Connection Types**:
   - Direct pod connection (internal Kubernetes network)
   - Kubernetes service (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
   - Ingress controllers for external access

2. **Port Requirements**:
   - SQL Server TDS port: 1433
   - Named instance ports: dynamic, starting from 49000
   - Data controller management ports

3. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Implement proper DNS resolution for SQL MI endpoints
   - Consider using CoreDNS customizations for Kubernetes
   - Set up external DNS for client connectivity

### Load Balancing

1. **Internal Load Balancing**:
   - Kubernetes services provide internal load balancing
   - Business Critical tier automatically uses Always On Availability Groups

2. **External Load Balancing**:
   - Use external load balancers for client connections
   - Configure health probes for availability monitoring
   - Implement session affinity for consistent connections

## High Availability Network Configurations

1. **General Purpose Tier**:
   - Network redundancy depends on underlying Kubernetes networking
   - Multiple network interfaces for redundancy
   - Proper routing for failover scenarios

2. **Business Critical Tier**:
   - Network requirements for Always On Availability Groups
   - Sufficient bandwidth for replica synchronization
   - Low-latency connectivity between replicas

3. **Multi-region Considerations**:
   - WAN connectivity for geo-distributed deployments
   - Traffic routing for disaster recovery scenarios
   - DNS configuration for failover

## Azure Integration Network Requirements

1. **Azure Arc Connectivity**:
   - Outbound connectivity to Azure Arc services
   - Proxy configuration if required
   - Service endpoints for Azure services

2. **Hybrid Network Scenarios**:
   - ExpressRoute for dedicated Azure connectivity
   - VPN configurations for secure communications
   - Traffic routing between Azure and on-premises

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Network paths for telemetry and monitoring data
   - Management traffic routing
   - Log collection network considerations

## Network Performance Optimization

1. **TCP Optimizations**:
   - Adjust TCP parameters for database workloads
   - Consider jumbo frames for internal traffic
   - Optimize TCP window sizes for high throughput

2. **Quality of Service (QoS)**:
   - Implement network QoS for critical database traffic
   - Prioritize transaction log traffic for synchronous replication
   - Configure bandwidth allocation for different traffic types

3. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**:
   - Deploy network monitoring tools
   - Collect network performance metrics
   - Establish baselines for network performance
